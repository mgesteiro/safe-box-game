Hi there!
Nice project, but there is an ERROR in your code:
code[i] = random(0,9);
This code only produces number between 0 and 8, as the second parameter of the function is "EXCLUSIVE" (see documentation). Your pin will never contain any number 9. The correct code should be:
code[i] = random(0,10);  // values from 0 to 9
Best regards!

I was trying to post a comment in your "Crack the Code" article, but got blocked with an error message saying that it was SPAM... ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It's a nice project that I'm recreating, but there is an error in your code, as the random(0,9) function only produces values between 0 and 8 (the 9 is EXCLUSIVE).

Let me know if you need further details.

Best regards!
